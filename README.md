The app can further be improved by getting different views of data. Right now, the color coding is according to the revenue percentage where the darkest green shows that the area has more number of pro users and lightest green shows that the area has less number of pro users. We can have multiple views and color coding for different types of users like male or female users, which area has more number of matches, etc. Also with respect to UI/UX, we could have light and dark mode for the map.

I have structured the folder structure in a way where adding more components and pages will not be a problem. We can just add files under different folders. It would be good for large scale projects containing storybook or reusable components with multiple pages.
